# Frontend Test

The project has two output scripts, one is for build and one for development.

The build script script output has been uploaded to: [https://williamchappell.com/huguenots-fe-test/](https://williamchappell.com/huguenots-fe-test/)

The development script handles live reload and spins up a web server so there shouldn't be prerequisites for getting the development environment up and running. The architecture behind this is vite so you might need to globally install that.

To get the project working you should just need to run:

- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

All the packages I've used can be found in the package.json file.
